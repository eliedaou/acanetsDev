extra_description: We initiate network commands such as ping and nslookup to measure the end-to-end delay and DNS lookup time. We also use file transfers to estimate upload and download bandwidth between clients and “CDN” servers. We plan to conduct these measurements continuously for six months, during which such network metrics are recorded along them their timestamps. In this way, we will obtain a large set of time series data, which essentially tell us the network performance in multiple dimensional (time, geographic, organization, ISP, KPI) representation.
