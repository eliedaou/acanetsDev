the_description: The STREAMS project plans to address the security challenges in transferring and processing patient related sensor data by developing a Secure Transport and REsearch Architecture for Monitoring Stroke Recovery (STREAMS), a technical proof-of-concept implementation, to secure end-to-end sensor data streams using secure software defined networking and elastic compute and storage resources.
extra_description: We initiate network commands such as ping and nslookup to measure the end-to-end delay and DNS lookup time. We also use file transfers to estimate upload and download bandwidth between clients and “CDN” servers. We plan to conduct these measurements continuously for six months, during which such network metrics are recorded along them their timestamps. In this way, we will obtain a large set of time series data, which essentially tell us the network performance in multiple dimensional (time, geographic, organization, ISP, KPI) representation.
