% Course details
\textbf {\large \\ Course Description:} 
This three-credit course provides a continuation of the study of microprocessors begun in 16.317. Topics include CPU architecture, memory interfaces and management, coprocessor interfaces, bus concepts, bus arbitration techniques, serial I/O devices, DMA and interrupt controlled devices. Focus will be placed on the design, construction, and testing of dedicated microprocessor systems (static and real-time). Hardware limitations of the single-chip system will be investigated along with microcontrollers, programming for small systems, interfacing, and communications, validating hardware and software, microprogramming of controller chips, and design methods and testing of embedded systems. Laboratories are directly related to microprocessor functions and embedded system designs. \\
\textbf {Prerequisite(s):} 16.311 - Electronics I Laboratory, 16.317 - Microprocessors Systems Design, 16.365 - Electronics I.

\textbf {Note(s):} All students enrolled in 16.480/552 Microprocessors Systems Design are required to have completed prerequisites or get permission from the Instructor. It is the student who is responsible for any adverse results such as being administratively withdrawn from the class or being ineligible for tuition refund due to the enforcement of these prerequisites.

\textbf {Credit Hours:} 3 \\

\textbf {\large Course Structure:} \\
There is a 3-hour class on Wednesday evening each week. The class will be in the format of lecture and laboratory.

\textbf {\large Grade Distribution:} \\
\hspace*{40mm}
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
Exam 1 & 20\% \\
Exam 2 & 20\% \\
Labs  & 60\% (four labs, 15\% each)\\
Total  & 100\%
\end{tabular} \\

Note: This course is double-numbered. Students enrolled in 16.480 are graded on a different scale from those in 16.552. Generally 60\% is the passing grade (D) for 16.480 students, 80\% is the passing grade (B) for 16.552 students.

% Course Policies. These are just examples, modify to your liking.
\textbf {\large Course Policies:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf {General}
		\begin{itemize}
			%\item Computers are not to be used unless instructed to do so.
			\item Exams are closed book, closed notes unless instructed otherwise.
			\item \textbf {No makeup exams will be given unless proper documents are presented (such as doctor's notes or police reports).}
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf {Labs and Reports}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Students are expected to work in teams of up to four people. However, {\bf each student is expected to complete and submit his/her own lab report.} The student must clearly establish authorship of a work in the report.

\textbf{Copying} reports from others is an act of \textbf{plagiarism}, which is a serious offense and \textbf{all involved parties will be penalized according to the Academic Integrity Policy}.
			\item \textbf{Penalty will be applied to late turn-ins: 20\% deduction per one late day.}.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Attendance and Absences}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Attendance is expected and may be taken each class. 

			\item Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for absence. It is also the absentee's responsibility to get all missing notes or materials. 
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% College Policies
\textbf {\large Academic Integrity Policy :} 
% This should be specific to your instituition, an example is provided.

The university has a responsibility to promote academic honesty and integrity and to develop procedures to deal effectively with instances of academic dishonesty. Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, for the appropriate citation of sources, and for respect of othersâ€™ academic endeavors. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the university.
